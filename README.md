# Schulze Vote

This gem is a Ruby implementation of the Schulze voting method (with help of the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm), 
a type of the Condorcet voting methods. It's the backend algorithm of [Agreeder](https://www.renuo.ch/en/products/agreeder) and [Airesis](https://airesis.eu).

## Install

``` bash
gem install schulze-vote
```

Gemfile

``` ruby
gem 'schulze-vote', require: 'schulze_vote'
```

## Usage

``` ruby
require 'schulze_vote'
vote_list = <<EOF
C;A;B
C;B;A
A;B;C
A;C;B
B;C;A
B;A;C
EOF
schulze_basic = SchulzeBasic.do(vote_list, candidate_count)
schulze_classifications.classification_with_ties # shows the final classification
```

Input:

* `vote_list`
  * Array of Arrays: votes of each voter as weights `[ [1,2,3],[3,2,1],[1,1,2] ]`
  * String: "A;B;C\nB,A;C\n;3=C;B;A"
  * File: first line **must** be a single integer, following lines like vote_list type String (see vote lists under `examples` directory)
* `candidate_count` Integer: number of options
  * **required** for vote_list types of Array and String
  * leave empty if vote_list is a File

### String/File format:

A typical voters line looks like this:

```
A;B;C;D;E;F
```

You also can say that _n_ voters have the same preferences:

```
n=F;E;D;C;B;A
```

where _n_ is an integer value for the count.

Also it's possible to say that a voter has candidates equally weighted:

```
A,B;C,D;E,F
```

which means, that A + B, C + D and E + F are on the same weight level.

Here only 3 weight levels are used: (A,B) = 3, (C,D) = 2, (E,F) = 1

### Why I must write the candidate count in the first line of the vote file?

_or: Why I must give a candidate count value for Array/String inputs?_

Very easy: The reason is, that voters can leave out candidates (they give no special preferences).

So, schulze-vote needs to know, how many real candidates are in the voting process.

### Examples

#### Array

Only weight values, no letters here

``` ruby
require 'schulze_vote'
vote_list_array = [[3,2,1],[1,3,2],[3,1,2]]
vs = SchulzeBasic.do vote_list_array, 3
```

```
voter  => A D C B

weight => 4,1,2,3

A is on first position = highest prio == 4
B is on last position                 == 1
C is on third position                == 2
D is on second position               == 3
```

Next versions will have an automatic Preference-to-Weight algorithm.
(Internally only integers are used for calculation of ranking.)

#### String

``` ruby
require 'schulze_vote'
vote_list_string = <<EOF
A;B;C
B;C;A
A;C;B
A,C,B
4=C;A;B
EOF
vs = SchulzeBasic.do vote_list_string, 3
```

#### File

``` ruby
require 'schulze_vote'
vs = SchulzeBasic.do File.open('path/to/vote.list')
```


### SchulzeBasic

It doesn't matter if you start counting at 0 (zero) or 1 (one).

Also it's not important, if you use jumps (like `1 3 5 9`).

Internally it will only check if candidate X > candidate Y

Output:

* `.ranking` Array: numbers of total wins for each candidate `[candidate A, candidate B, candidate C, ...]`
* `.winners_array` Array: set 1 if the candidate is a potential winner `[candidate A, candidate B, candidate C, ...]`
* `.vote_matrix` Matrix: it contains the pairwise defeats
* `.play_matrix` Matrix: it contains the strongest paths
* `.result_matrix` Matrix: it contains the beat pairwise
* `.beat_couples` Array of Pairs: it contains the beat pairwise in array format
* `.ties` Array of Array: it contains the ties between candidates
* `.potential_winners` Array: it contains the possible winners



## Example

Example 1 from Wikipedia

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MarkusSchulze/Schulze_method_examples>

Result should be:

``` ruby
votestring = <<EOF
5=A;C;B;E;D
5=A;D;E;C;B
8=B;E;D;A;C
3=C;A;B;E;D
7=C;A;E;B;D
2=C;B;A;D;E
7=D;C;E;B;A
8=E;B;A;D;C
EOF
vs = SchulzeBasic.do(votestring, 5)
puts_m vs.vote_matrix

#=> [0, 20, 26, 30, 22]
    [25, 0, 16, 33, 18]
    [19, 29, 0, 17, 24]
    [15, 12, 28, 0, 14]
    [23, 27, 21, 31, 0]
   
puts_m vs.play_matrix

#=> [0, 28, 28, 30, 24]
    [25, 0, 28, 33, 24]
    [25, 29, 0, 29, 24]
    [25, 28, 28, 0, 24]
    [25, 28, 28, 31, 0]

puts vs.winners_array.to_s

#=> [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

puts_m vs.result_matrix

#=> [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

vs.classifications.each do |classification|
  puts classification.map { |e| idx_to_chr(e) }.to_s
end

#=> ["E", "A", "C", "B", "D"]
```


## Classifications

You have a `SchulzeClassifications.new(vs).classifications(limit_results = false)` that you can call.
If the number of results is greater then the `limit_results` parameter then a `TooManyClassificationsException`
is raised.
If you set this parameter to any value other then `false` be careful to catch and manage the exception properly.

## Classification with ties

You have a `SchulzeClassifications.new(vs).classification_with_ties` that you can call.
This method return a uniq classification in array of arrays format to display results on screen.
Please note that for cases like this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MarkusSchulze/Schulze_method_examples#Example_4> 
it will return the following: [[B,D], [A,C]]

## Tests

Run `bundle exec rspec` to run tests.

### Random votation generator

You can run `bundle exec ruby spec/example_generator.rb [CANDIDATES_NUM] [VOTES_NUM] to generate a random election file in the `examples` folder.

## Contributing to schulze-vote

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Use git-flow
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
